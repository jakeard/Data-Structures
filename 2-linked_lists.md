# Linked Lists

A list in python is variable length, and all of its values are stored right next to each other in memory. A linked list is like a list, but the values can be stored anywhere, randomly in memory. This means that you can not just find the fifth element of the list by doing `my_list[4]`. A linked list uses **nodes** and **links** to find the next and/or previous values. A linked list can be more efficient, especially if you are adding or removing from the head or tail of a list.

## Nodes

Nodes are connecting points in a graph. In the sense of a linked list, they contain the value at that current node, and a link to the next node, or the next node and the previous node if it is a **doubly linked list**.

A node can look something like this:

![Node](images/linked-list.png)

As you can see, the node contains the data, and a link to the next node. The first node in a linked list is known as the head, and the last is the tail. The tail points to **NULL** or **None**, signifying that it is the end of the linked list, until something new is added. Python uses None, so that is what I wil use to describe this.

Multiple nodes together in a linked list look like this:

![Multiple Nodes](images/linked-list_many.png)

This list has the first element (the head), a middle element, and the last element (the tail) which points to NULL.

A doubly linked list is similar to a singly linked list, but also has links to the node before the current node, and the head node will also point to None in its previous link, just as the tail node will point to NULL in its next link. A doubly linked list looks like this:

## Insert and Delete

As with any list, sometimes you will need to insert or delete a value from the list. The way to insert or delete is different based on if the node you are changing is at the front, back, or in the middle. For the following examples, doubly linked lists will be used.

### Empty List

if the linked list has no nodes in it, then the node that you insert will have both its previous and next pointers be None, and it will be both the head and the tail.

### Insert Front

Inserting at the front is fairly simple, and just requires that you set the next pointer to the current head of the linked list, and the previous pointer to None. In this example, the head already exists, and we are replacing it with our new node.

```python
"""Create the new node"""

# Set the new node's data
new_node.data = 45

# Set the node's next value to the list's current head
new_node.next = my_linked_list.head

# Set the new node's previous value to None
new_node.prev = None

# Set the new node to now be the current head of the list
new_node = my_linked_list.head

# Set the new head's next node's previous link to be the new head
my_linked_list.head.next.prev = my_linked_list.head 
```

The example changed the list from something like this:

![Insert Head Before](images/insert_head1.png)

To this:

![Insert Head After](images/insert_head2.png)

### Insert Back

Inserting at the back is very similar to inserting at the front. It is the same, except you change the tail instead of the head.

```python
"""Create the new node"""

# Set the new node's data
new_node.data = 45

# Set the node's next value to None
new_node.next = None

# Set the new node's previous value to the list's current tail
new_node.prev = my_linked_list.tail

# Set the new node to now be the current tail of the list
new_node = my_linked_list.tail

# Set the new tail's next node's next link to be the new tail
my_linked_list.tail.prev.next = my_linked_list.tail 
```

The example pictures from inserting at the head are almost the same, just that the node with data 45 would be inserted at the end of the list.

### Insert Middle

Inserting at the middle is a little bit more complicated. We need to update both the node before and the node after where we want to put our new node.

```python
"""Create the new node"""

# Choose a node that you are going to insert after, usually using its data value
for node in my_linked_list:
    if node.data == 31:
        current_node = node

# Set the new node's data
new_node.data = 50

# Set the node's next value to the current node's next value
new_node.next = current_node.next

# Set the new node's previous value to the current node
new_node.prev = current_node

# Set the current node's next node's previous value to the new node
current_node.next.prev = new_node

# Set the current node's next value to the new node
current_node.next = new_node
```

This picture explains how this code works:

### Delete Front

Deleting at the front is also simple, just like inserting at the front. Basically you are just doing the exact opposite of what you did to insert at the front.

```python
# Set the head's next node's previous link to None
my_linked_list.head.next.prev = None

# Set the linked list's head to the current head's next node
my_linked_list.head = my_linked_list.head.next
```

That is all! You just have to set the head's next node's previous link to None, and then set the head to that same node that you just changed. This unattaches the current head, taking it off of the linked list.

The linked list went from this:

![Remove Head Before](images/insert_head2.png)

To this:

![Remove Head After](images/insert_head1.png)

### Delete Back

Similar to insert back, in that it is pretty much the opposite.

```python
# Set the tail's previous node's next link to None
my_linked_list.tail.prev.next = None

# Set the linked list's tail to the current tail's next node
my_linked_list.tail = my_linked_list.tail.prev
```

It really is as simple as that! The pictures from deleting from the front are similar to deleting in the back, just that the node with data value 1 would be removed, leaving just 45 and 3.

### Delete Middle

Again, similar to insert middle, because it is basically the opposite, but requires less steps.

```python
# Choose a node that you are going to delete, usually using its data value
for node in my_linked_list:
    if node.data == 31:
        current_node = node

# Set the node's previous node's next value to the current node's next value
current_node.prev.next = current_node.next

# Set the node's next node's previous value to the current node's previous value
current_node.next.prev = current_node.prev
```

## Other Operations and Big O

Python does not have a built in linked list data structure, but you can use one by using a double ended queue from the deque library (`import deque`).

Some common operations that can be used on linked lists, along with their Big O are as follows:

## Example

The examples given in the inserting and deletion segment of this tutorial assumes that a linked list class has already been made to take care of the operations. Those examples are what will help you in the problem set.
